[Multicore Programming] putting pressure on programmers, challenges include:
	Dividing activities
	Balance
	Data splitting
	Data dependency
	Testing and debugging

[Parallelism] implies a system can perform more than one task simultaneously

Amdahl's Law
	speedup <= 1/(S+(1-S)/N)
		S is serial portion
		N processing cores
