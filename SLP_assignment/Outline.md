Bellman-Ford:
Consider that there is a graph G with n nodes and v vertices. The requirement is finding the length of shortest path from vertex v to every other vertex.

To solve this problem, there are numerous of algorithms to find the shortest path such as Dijkstra's algorithm. Despite the faster speed, Dijkstra's algorithm is not available to tackle the negative weighted contained graph. In this report, therefore, we will introduce the Bellman-Ford algorithm as the tool to deduce negative path and find the successive shortest path.

To begin with, the Bellman-Ford algorithm is an algorithm that computes shortest path from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph. The algorithm is created by two American scientists Richard Bellman and Lester Ford.

Similar to Dijkstra's algorithm, Bellman–Ford also relies on a process of relaxation, wherein initial approximations of distances are continually replaced with improved ones until the optimal solution is reached. Both algorithms ensure that the approximate distance to each vertex remains an overestimate, and updates occur by choosing the minimum between the current value and the length of a newly discovered path. However, Dijkstra's algorithm uses a priority queue to selectively process the closest unexplored vertex, relaxing all its outgoing edges. In contrast, the Bellman–Ford algorithm relaxes all edges in each iteration, repeating this process |V|−1 times, where |V| is the number of vertices. With each repetition, the number of vertices with accurately calculated distances increases, ensuring that ultimately, all vertices attain their correct distances. This approach enables the Bellman–Ford algorithm to handle a broader range of inputs compared to Dijkstra. While the intermediate results may be influenced by the order of edge relaxation, the final answer remains consistent.
